# 0nset
Data analysis to find the onset value

The code used for "Accurate Determination of the Onset
Wavelength (onset) in Optical Spectroscopy" is found in
v_2.0.7

The updated 0nset v_2.1.1 contains the same algorithm in
v_2.0.7 but has fewer issues with user input. Additionally, 
some useful local minima and maxima information is provided 
with each dataset to aide the user in selecting better 
intervals.
